==== Set Up ====
Make sure the cache directories are writable by your web server. 

Requires: PHP5 with XSL. 

==== License ====
To be confirmed. Open.

==== Notes ====
No clean-up for the cache is implemented at present, so you may want to set up a cron job to clear at least the JSON cache directory regularly.
